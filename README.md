The curiousity to learn new things is what drives me every day.

Back in 2016, my friend told me about iOS course on Udemy that he bought. I've decided to give it a shot and it was the best decision of my life. I've been coding or learning new technologies almost every day since then.

I've started by creating mobile apps, later shifted my focus towards web apps, took Harvard's CS50 to fill gaps, landed my first programming full time job and somehow got offered a Splunk position which opened doors to dozens of different technologies.

In 2021, I've deep dived into the crypto world, not just into a trading but I've learned about crypto history, fundamentals and core functionality. Now, I am learning about development of dApps, web3 and smart contracts.
